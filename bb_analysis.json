Your ability to work hard through storms.\n2. Your ability to stay humble through glory.\n\nSaturn is a task master. Saturn is an examiner.\n\nIt's not been an easy year for me either. I have put my head down and worked through it all.\n\nSome times, while my head was down and working... my eyes teared up with the pressure of being an adult. \n\nSome times while my head was down and working... God gave me moments to smile & breathe.\n\nIt's been a year that's tested me to my last degree of resistance.\n\nIt's a year that's taught me : Faith and belief can overcome the false storms of what we call \"suffering\"\n\nMy knee injury was a gift as much as my national award was.\n\nMy poor mental health was a gift as much as public adulation was.\n\nLife's purpose is to grow. Often through the dungeons of suffering as much as through the dungeons of success.\n\nGet even healthier this year.\nMeditate deeply this year.\nPursue peace this year.\n\nBut whatever you do, believe that God is with you through every step.\n\nHappy 2025, have a blessed one!\n\n2025 - Year of \"Mars\"\n\nPour your intensity into the speed and strength of your work.\nNow overcome your own demons.\nNow grow more easily. \n\n#spirituality #theranveershow #God",

  "caption": "Merry Christmas to you all, from Goa. It's been the most eventful Christmas of my life. \n\nGonna be very vulnerable in this write up.\n\nWe're perfectly fine & well now. But yesterday at 6:00 pm or so, my girlfriend and I had to be rescued from a bit of a situation.\n\nWe both love swimming in the open ocean. I've been doing this since I was a kid. \n\nBut yesterday we got swept away by an underwater current. \nThis has happened to me before but I've never been alongside a companion.\n\nIt's easy to swim out of one alone. It's very hard to pull someone out with you.\n\nAfter a 5-10 minute struggle, we called for help and were promptly rescued by a family of 5 swimming nearby.\n\nWe're both good swimmers but the fury of nature is such that it WILL test your limits at some point.\n\nA casual, fun dip in the waves was interrupted by an underwater current that toppled both of us. The next thing we knew was that we were both struggling to stay afloat.\n\nThere was a point during the ordeal where I swallowed a lot of water and started fading away a little bit. That's when I decided to shout for help.\n\nDeep gratitude to the family of the IPS officer husband and IRS officer wife who saved us both.\n\nThis experience left us feeling both blank as well as grateful. We felt the protection of God throughout the incident.\n\nAs we moved into today's Christmas, we're simply full of gratitude for being alive.\n\nAlmost feel like this one life experience has changed my perspective towards living.\n\nWriting this because I've always shared these moments with you all. Full of emotion and gratitude today. A deep thank you and big hugs to each one of you reading this!\n\nLast evening, I decided to call my brother @brother.salvador to convey the Christmas Eve incident. He performed a prayer for us where we thanked Lord Jesus Christ as well as the God above us. \n\nThis has been a very very memorable Goa holiday for me. From discovering secret Murtis at @aliladiwagoa to touching the life-death barrier.\n\nI guess 2025 is going to be more blessed than ever.\n\nWe lived for a reason!\n\nMerry Christmas to you all and to your families. Thank you God, for life! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª‚ô•Ô∏è",

Nothing gives me true happiness. No awards, no career highlights, NOTHING.\n\nI am wired to not celebrate. Because I know how much failing has hurt past versions of me.\n\nThe less you celebrate success, the less that failure stings when it inevitably happens.\n\nI don't think that this is a healthy mentality for the long term.\nBut right now, this mindset helps tremendously.\n\nEvery year I compete with only one person. \nMe from the previous year.\n\nFortunately, I've won for 9 years straight. \n\nPerhaps this year we win the battle of \"work-life-balance\" as well.\n\nLife shouldn't be all about work. \nIntense years should be embraced.\nBreezy years should be embraced.\n\nNow we enter our 10th year.\n\nI'm prepared to win & not celebrate again throughout 2025.\n\nBut today, we celebrate fully.\n\nToday is a good day because my 2024 shoot schedule comes to an end.\n\n2024 year end :\n\nThe goals that once seemed like dreams, have now become possible.\n\nThank you to my beautiful team @teambeerbiceps.\n\nThank you to my üåª\n\nAnd thank you to God.\n\nSingapore, UK & Dubai done.

Shot some edgy podcasts here. Can't wait to put them out! \n\nIt's not easy to travel more than 7500 km away from home and shoot high quality podcasts. My brothers @akshattiiwari & @aayushtiiwari are with me on this legendary tour. We're making magic happen in this corner of the world.\n\nFor @theranveershowpodcast, we've already shot 9 epic episodes in the UK. A few more to go before we return to the motherland.\n\nBut TRS has GONE GLOBAL. And we will only continue to create content for a world audience!\n\nKeep supporting us. We're on a mission to become India's voice to the world.\n\nNow off to London for our last few shoots.\n\nCan't wait to return to the historical, artistic, gothic, thrilling, ENCHANTING land of Yorkshire üëª\n\n#TRSUKTour üèπ\n\nIndia to the world, baby.",

There is no end to life's challenges & aches. Pain is compulsory & suffering is optional.\n\n2. The way your mind processes suffering can be drastically changed if \"spiritual practices\" are a central theme in your life.\n\n3. Meditating, journaling & manifesting are modern & 'cool' alternatives to deeper, more ancient practices.\n\n4. These deeper practices are often rejected by modern humans because they seem to be \"illogical\" or \"orthodox\".\n\n5. Every religion contains evil humans that manipulate other people into accepting twisted forms of rituals under the garb of religion. Knowledge is power. Protect yourself by questioning everything. Move forward with a ritual if it makes sense to YOU.\n\n6. Before jumping to conclusions about rituals of ANY faith, always try experiencing those rituals yourself. Replace judgement with curiosity.\n\n7. Rituals if done with understanding & emotion can be a much more powerful spiritual practice than you'd think!\n\nIn this video, my elder brother and mentor @om.dhumatkar is conducting a Hanumana havan for @teambeerbiceps in our office. \n\nImmensely powerful experience because everyone was vibrating on the same frequency. This 2 hour havan (along with its explanations) left us all feeling purified & enhanced.\n\nUnfortunately I had to sit on a chair because I've torn my knee ligament. But when the heart contains love & respect, the ritual allows for a tiny bending of rules (ideally I should have been on the floor.) \n\nLove growing older because of experiences like this. \n\nHealing more every year, Aum Hum Hanumate Namaha!\n\n#hindu #spiritual #positivity",

  "caption": "Thoughts I've had about having children :\n\n1. Perhaps having kids is the 4th most important aspect of a human birth. The others being :\n- Spiritual growth.\n- Taking care of your parents\n- Giving back to society, through your work.\n\n2. I'm sure that the birth of your kids makes you more responsible. But maybe it also makes you relive your childhood. And therefore makes you dive deeper into your own psyche.\n\n3. Spiritual growth is definitely accelerated if you protect & raise a child. Living for the sake of another human being is one of the greatest things that one can do in a human birth.\n\n4. One needs to be financially, spiritually and biologically ready to bring life into this world. Be aware of \"responsibility\", before multiple duties become your reality.\n\n5. Having progeny is your chance at the propulsion of your value system into the future. If your kids make the world a better place, you have done your bit for society. \n\n6. Considering where world population demographics currently stand, many believe that a couple should produce more than 2 children. Personally I want more than 2 kids. But not at the cost of the quality of fatherhood I can provide. Time will tell...\n\n7. As I age, I love my parents more with every passing year. I also realise that I carry generational trauma & tendencies that I've inherited from my bloodline. Fatherhood will be my test. What am I passing on to the next generation? What tendencies or trauma will be held back from reaching them?\n\nAll I can do now is work on being the best version of myself.\n\n---\n\nEvery stage of adult life throws new challenges your way.\n\nIf you put your mind to it, you'll become better annually.\n\nStudy about fatherhood.\nStudy people's mistakes.\nVisualise a warm reality.\nPrepare for responsibility.\n\n#spirituality #fatherhood",

  "caption": "9 years of BeerBiceps. I now enter my 10th.\n\nAt the beginning of my career, my mind was full of ideas, but my heart was full of self doubt. \n\nIt took delusion, shamanic healing, meditation, books, mentors, therapy & luck to get this far.\n\nSomewhere along the way, a false sense of self belief was born in me. I took this \"false self belief\" & executed upon ideas incessantly.\n\nEventually, my team and I started receiving public adulation as well as growth in numbers. The false self belief turned into real self belief. \n\nThe 9 year journey has perpetually been about execution. Perhaps only to feel better about myself and my capabilities.\n\nThe highs have never been celebrated enough or enjoyed completely. That is just how I believe a true warrior should live life. It may simply be a mechanism that protects one over time.\n\nThe lows have always been met with grief, heightened discipline & harsher self talk. It has not been an easy journey for me. \n\nThere's definitely a part of my mind and heart that feels torn apart and shredded thanks to the stories of the last 9 years. \n\nBut there's also a part of me that's trying to become more 'still' with time. \n\nMore detached. More process driven.\n\nI tell myself that I'm born to be a GOAT.\nI tell myself that I'm born for an infinitely long journey of improvement.\nI tell myself that sadness, pain & strife can't pierce my heart.\n\nAll of the above 3 lines are lies. \n\nBut they help me carry on. \nThey help me focus on the week at hand. \nThey help me get better every year.\n\nIn my head, I'm already the GOAT I wish to become. In my heart, I feel the bruises of years of negative self talk.\n\nBut I carry on with the biggest lesson I learnt from Yogananda Paramhansa : Wake up every morning with faith in God & a warrior spirit. No difficulty can beat the bravery within a spiritual heart.\n\nSamurai mentality : Detachment, constant improvement & ferocity in execution.\n\nNow... it's time to reinvent üï∑Ô∏è\n\nThank you for the support over the last 9 years.

Happened very randomly when a brother tripped & fell on me during a game.\n\nHeard a pop in my knee and knew immediately that it was something serious. The physical pain kept building up over the next 2-3 days. Fortunately, I began immediate sports Physiotherapy with my saviour @drdivyacures!\n\nBeen consistent with my physio routine throughout these 9 days. And the pain is decreasing rapidly.\n\nCurrently on the road to recovery and likely dodging the need for a surgery.\n\nI've now realised how important one's knees are.

The more wisdom you absorb from the minds of sages, the less society's shortcomings will bother you.\n- Autobiography of a Yogi\n- Doorways To Light (Krishnananda)\n- Ancient Science Of Mantras (Om Swami)\n- Any book by Rajarshi Nandy\n\n2. Worked really hard at my material career from early on. The quicker your material needs are taken care of, the sooner your consciousness travels to the realms of what's beyond human limitation.\n\n3. Meditating daily. To begin, use @levelsupermind.\n\n4. Conversations with (much) older people. Eventually you realise that only regrets & relationships matter. And beyond the realms of regret & relationships lies the realm of divinity. In the ultimate end, only your equation with divinity matters.\n\n5. Travelling within India. Yes it's chaotic. Yes, it can be slightly unhygienic. But if you're willing to go beyond these obstacles, you will find consciousness elevating geographies in places like Banaras, Rishikesh, Vrindavan & many more.\n\n6. Not celebrating victories for too long.\n\n7. Constantly visualising a life without :\n- My favourite foods.\n- My favourite activities.\n- My loved ones.\n- My physical capabilities.\n- Money, success & adulation.\n\n8. Living a life without any intoxication. Giving up alcohol in 2018 was a game changer for me. Giving up meat around the same time was an equally big game changer.\n\n9. Using sadness to write or create. Using happiness to convey joy to others. Perceiving both simply as tools rather than as states of the mind. Because even thoughts should NOT be taken seriously. They are not in your control. \n\nThe only thing in your control is your perception of your thoughts & life.\n\n---",

But days like this don't come your way randomly.\n\nI truly believe that they're sent to you by the universe. To remind you that life is about much more than just your physical (& mental) body's limitations.\n\nToday's strangely poetic meeting was a reminder for me.\n\nI remembered a Bruce Lee quote that I'd go back to a lot while starting off my career : \n\n\"The mind that perceives the limitation, is the limitation.\"\n\n---\n\nThis special episode with Major DP will be out on Kargil Vijay Diwas. 2024 marks the 25th year anniversary of our victory in Kargil. \n\nMay we always remember the sacrifices of our warriors from back in 1999. \n\nHope everyone ends up watching this military special episode.\n\nPersonally, I feel extremely uplifted after speaking with sir.

  "caption": "9 things to know about \"Siddhis\" : \n\n1. Some version of \"Siddhis\" or 'divine abilities' is spoken about in every religion in the world. \n\n2. In the modern day, very few humans adopt a disciplined spiritual path. Hence a very small percentage can even experience powerful \"Siddhis\" being blessed upon them. \n\n3. In Hinduism, Siddhis are considered roadblocks or obstacles even though they might seem positive on the surface. A \"superpower\" may be exciting in the beginning but its purpose is to test your determination to get to the ultimate goal - Union with the divine. \n\n4. The more you meditate/pray, the closer you get to achieving the goal you were sent here for. When one is bestowed with a Siddhi, their ego may get inflated. Siddhis are the divine's method of testing your humility and intentions.\n\n5. Siddhis and many aspects of spirituality are beyond the limits of where science has currently reached. Absence of evidence should never mean an evidence of absence. Skeptics will never be convinced about further human evolution. Perhaps they're not yet meant to climb the ladder of spiritual evolution. Step 1 : Be open. \n\n6. The heightened \"calmness\" or \"focus\" that's scientifically proved by studies on meditation is only the first, tiny version of what \"siddhis\" truly are. \n\n7. They should not be your motivation. But they will definitely help boost your material prospects. \n\n8. If you pray/meditate for the sake of material growth, you will likely not gain siddhis because you'll likely not go far up the ladder.\n\n9. Read \"Autobiography of a Yogi\".\n\nBegin your meditation journey today on @levelsupermind.",

But what about love? \n\nIs love different for the two sexes? I don't know. \n\nWhat I do know is that most men around me don't know how to handle true love. And hence don't know how to handle true heartbreak.\n\nThe only thing that helped me navigate both romance and loneliness were experiences from older men & women. \n\nI hope that this clip serves the purpose for younger men at least. When I was a boy, I always thought - \"I will not be able to get over this.\"\n\nBut time & sleep heal. And life makes your heart even deeper.\n\nLife gets sweeter as you age.

Respect both immensely because they're both INDIA players. \n\nAlso been a life long @mumbaiindians fan. \n\nBreaks my heart to see our beloved Wankhede booing Hardik because of situations out of his control.\n\nI adore Rohit. Given us so many of our best cricket memories. \n\nBut my love for Rohit doesn't turn into a lack of love for Hardik.\n\nIn my eyes he's the most BALLSY cricketer we currently have. Always steps up during knockout games. \nAlways makes his presence count when it's needed.\n\nWhy people are upset at Hardik Pandya : \n- Apparently insisted on Rohit's removal from captaincy.\n- Apparently is causing a divide in the MI dressing room.\n\nNeither of these are confirmed theories.\n\nWhat people don't talk about : \n- Hardik has a supreme record as a captain during his last 2 seasons with GT.\n- Hardik (perhaps) would not have been ready to leave his captaincy at a successful franchise unless he was promised captaincy at the Mumbai Indians as well.\n\nMumbai Indians has ALWAYS strived for excellence. \nIt's been the most successful franchise in IPL cricket.\n\nWho are we to debate on the decisions of an experienced (and proven) management? There are countless fan opinions. \n\nHere's mine :\n\nIn my opinion, our job as fans is to cheer ESPECIALLY for Indian players. When you boo Hardik, you affect the confidence of one of our most important players, going into the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nJust had to put this out today.\n\nHad a blast speaking with the great @michaelvaughan on @theranveershowpodcast. \n\nAdore these cricket podcasts because I get to talk to experts, but as a fan!

Multiple ancient texts govern how modern Hindus think.\n\n3. There are no strict rules. But as is the case with all faiths, we have our share of extremists as well. \n\n4. Extremists in my eyes give Hinduism a bad name in the modern day. \n\nHow most Hindus feel : Whether it's Islam, Christianity, Sikhi, Buddhism, Jainism, Judaisam or even the so called \"Pagan faiths\" of tribals... \n\nYou'll always find Hindus who will bow down in respect to all of these. Most of us would be happy to come to your place of worship and bow our head in divine reverence. \n\nHinduism, when you study it enough speaks repeatedly about different pathways to the same force we call \"God\".\n\n5. Many Hindus hold pain of the past millennium in their heart. But this pain is fading rapidly with the younger generation. \n\nWhere there is generational trauma, some anger always originates. But for the most of us, we care too much about the present of our nation. We look towards a secular, ambitious future with INDIAN people of all faiths ‚ô•Ô∏èüáÆüá≥\n\n6. Study some of our texts for life guidance. Follow all your faith's practices but also GAIN from the gifts of ancient Indian culture. \n\nIn my experience, inter religious studies always improve empathy and the quality of life.\n\nHere are some text names and why they should be studied :\n\n1. Bhagavad Geeta : For psychological and emotional guidance to help you navigate tough times.\n\n2. Garud Purana : For an in depth look into \"after-life\" philosophy. Death is the theme, detachment is the lesson.\n\n3. Tantra Shastra (look up books by Rajarshi Nandy) : For a mind bending journey into ancient India and the reasons behind elaborate prayer rituals. \n\n4. Autobiography of a Yogi : Yogananda Paramhansa's legendary writings. Will teach you about how you can potentially evolve into a state of higher consciousness in this lifetime itself.

During my childhood, the visual image of \"God\" for me was Hanumanji.\n\nAs life moved on, my faith stayed strong. I grew up fairly religious (& secular, mind you). But at age 22, a deep spiritual journey also began. \n\nIt's only at age 26, with the start of the podcast that I realised  that religion in its core is spirituality itself. \n\n\"Spirituality\" is simply a modern word used to describe an ancient openness present in all of us. \n\nI deep dived into my religion - Sanatan Dharma once again. \n\nUnderstood the power of deities. Their different purposes. And especially their all encompassing omnipresent greatness. \n\nDeities are the manifestation of God itself. But depending on where you are in life, you'll be drawn to a particular deity because of its characteristics.\n\nAge 29 was tough. Moved out of my parental house for the first time. Began my \"prime YouTuber work phase\" period. Burnt myself out.\n\nThen rediscovered my childhood practice of a daily reading of the Hanuman Chalisa. An Awadhi prayer that contains serious strength giving abilities. That celebrates my childhood superhero - Hanumanji.\n\nRock bottom was met with therapy, meditation & also a daily Hanuman prayer. \n\nPeople often underestimate the power of their familial roots. Only until life punches them in the stomach. And eventually in their 30s, they all return. \n\nWhatever religion you followed when you were a child. That's the safe haven you will return to in your 30s & 40s. \n\nDon't run away from your roots to simply be socially acceptable. The world is accepting originality & devotion as mainstream now.\n\nThis is the kind of content I actually wish to share on social media. This is truly where I am in life at this moment. \n\nRaw, real & religious... \n\nNothing wrong with celebrating your own roots, do it proudly and help make THE WORLD a better place. \n\nJai Siya Ram.

You don't have to network with everyone, but you must stay in touch with those you choose to network with. \n\n6. Ask stupid questions in order to find where opportunities lie. \n\n7. When presented with an opportunity beyond your capabilities, accept it and then figure out how to execute upon it.\n\n8. Seek out people who you wish to become in due course. Then try to work with them.\n\n9. You'll learn more from a year spent with a professional than from 15 years of education. Intern as early as possible.\n\n10. Technology and therefore the world are changing rapidly. Consume deep, long form content to stay ahead of the pack.\n\n11. Social media will become an additional skill set required for most jobs. Begin polishing the \"social media skill\" immediately.\n\n12. 4 C's : Collaboration, Creativity, Critical Thinking & Communication Skills are the only 4 skills that can never be replaced by technology.

Great üòÇ\n\nValidation that 8 years of work have made us mainstream in India...\n\nIf you're not a part of meme culture after almost a decade spent in the media world, you're doing something wrong.\n\n2. How do I feel about people who want to troll us? I feel acceptance towards their opinions. \n\nAt some point in your career, you realise that not everyone will vibe with your work. That's how the world works. Even Kohli, SRK & Taylor Swift have people who dislike their work. \n\nThe key is to keep going & keep catering to your own community. \n\n3.
